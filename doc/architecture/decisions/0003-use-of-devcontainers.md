# 3. Use of DevContainers

Date: 2024-09-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In modern development workflows, maintaining consistent and reproducible development environments is crucial. To address the challenges associated with environment configuration and ensure uniformity across development setups, DevContainers are considered as a solution.

## Decision

We have decided to use DevContainers to standardize the development environment across different projects and team members. DevContainers offer several key benefits that align with our goals of improving productivity, ensuring consistency, and simplifying environment management.

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Development Environment**: DevContainers provide a consistent and isolated development environment by defining it within a Docker container. This ensures that all team members have the same setup, including all necessary dependencies and tools, regardless of their local machine configuration.

1. **Simplified Onboarding**: New developers can quickly get up and running with the predefined DevContainer configuration, reducing the time and effort required for environment setup and minimizing issues related to inconsistent environments.

1. **Isolation**: By using DevContainers, the development environment is isolated from the host system. This prevents conflicts between project dependencies and system-wide software, creating a clean and controlled environment.

1. **Version Control for Environment**: The environment configuration is version-controlled alongside the code. This ensures that changes to the environment are tracked, allowing for easy review and rollback if needed.

1. **IDE Integration**: DevContainers integrate seamlessly with popular IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code. This allows developers to work within the containerized environment directly from the IDE, providing support for tasks such as debugging, code editing, and more.

1. **Reproducibility**: DevContainers make the development environment reproducible across different machines and setups. This reduces discrepancies between development, testing, and production environments.

1. **Consistency Across CI/CD Pipelines**: By using DevContainers, the same environment is used during development and in CI/CD pipelines, helping to catch environment-related issues early in the development process.

## Consequences

* Developers need Docker and a compatible IDE to fully utilize DevContainers.

* There is a learning curve associated with Docker and DevContainers, which may require some initial training or adjustment for team members.

* Configuring and maintaining DevContainers adds some overhead, but this is offset by the long-term benefits of environment consistency and streamlined onboarding.
